# 2 - DotNetCore / AspNetCore / NodeJS

You will get to know the dotnetcore commandline tools and how to build dotnetcore apps from scratch. 

If you haven't done so already; install dotnetcore on your machine.

You should do these exercises with VSCode and commandline to get more learning from the process.
